# ASSIGNMENT TWO: ART PROJECT

## Description:
- This assignment requires students to make creative art projects using processing. After learning conditional loops and statements, the students are now able to play with repetitions, hence allowing more room for creativity
- In this project, students are encouraged to use meaningful variable names as well as function names, if any are used.

## The process:
- My favorite part about this assignment was that I had no idea what it was exactly that I wanted to create before I started coding, but once I opened processing and started trying different shapes and functions, I was able to tweak different elements to come up with the final result. This just goes to show that a huge part of the creative process is just diving into the unknown and see what it has in store at that point in time.
- Below are screenshots of different stages of the project

First: Draw thin red lines from (0,0) to many different points around the canvas

Second: Add more red lines from (150,150) to the same points to form a web-like structure

Third: Add two more points along the same line to intensify the number of crossings

Fourth: Add two more points till (600,600) to complete the web structure

Fifth: Add Orange line with similar patterns to create a smudgy figure

Sixth: Add Yellow on top of the Orange and Red lines that have been drawn

And may be one can tell where this is going: I followed ROYGBIV(colors of the rainbow), whilst incrementing the starting points by 1 point to create a rainbow effect with the lines slightly smearing

## Difficulties:
- Frankly, this assignment was much easier compared to the first. The biggest roadblock that I came across was lack of direction. Like I stated in the process section, I did not have a clear goal that I was working towards, therefore I pretty much just had to do trial and error. As a person that appreciates organization and orderliness, this was quite challenging.

## Interesting things I discovered:
- Not that I used this in my assignment, but I found out that functions in java can only be used as part of a class (Methods) if one wants to pass variables with them. As someone who is fluent in both Python and C++, I found this to be quite limiting, therefore I had to initiate the same variables in all my functions.

## Outcome:
