### Description:
- My final project is based on a program that will be asking the user to fill the blanks in quotes based on simple multiple choices.

### The process:
- It took me over a month to get myself to complete this project, but I finally made it, and I was able to push myself to come up with a simple idea to complete the project.

The inspiration came from my love for reading and mental health and wellness awareness. So, most of these quotes are going to be some motivational and inspirational quotes that I have come across in my life so far.

### Difficulties:
- The biggest difficulty I faced was getting the motivation to start.


### Interesting things I discovered:
