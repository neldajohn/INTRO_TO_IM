# MIDTERM PROJECT: WORD-GAME

## Description:
- This is a game of words falling from the sky. The main task that the player has it to catch the words and to make sure that not more than 5 words are lost. 

### - Instructions:
- Use the LEFT and RIGHT keys to move sideways
- Use the UP and DOWN keys to move vertically
- Knock the words as they fall.
- Make sure that not more than 5 words are lost

## Inspiration:
- This game was inspired by a game that I used to play in elementary school during my typing class. We were given some prompts that we had to type into the computer, and
once we completed those prompts, we were allowed to play games... and this happened to be my favorite game. I plan to store and let my little brother and niece play. 

## The Process:

## Major problems:
- I could not figure out how to delete objects from an array. I tried switching my words Array into an ArrayList, but it all crashed and I had to restart the project.
- I could not figure out how to end the game. And even when I did, I had a hard time figuring out how to restart it. 

## Modifications and Solutions:
- I decided to make an arraylist of the positions of all the words that had been knocked by the player. And then, before displaying any word, I would check to confirm
if the word had been knocked or not. If it was, it would not be displayed or updated. 

## Interesting things I discovered:
- 

## Outcome:

## Potential areas of improvement:
- I would like to make a list of categories of words to be used by the player. For example, Level one should be just animal names, and level two could be just plants
- I would also like to add sprites per level. As cute as smiley faces are, I still think sprites have better graphics. 

## Conclusion:
- This was an amazing experience. I am so happy that I was able to make this game from scratch despite my initial fear of not being able to complete this whole project.
