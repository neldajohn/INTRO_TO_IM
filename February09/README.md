# ASSIGNMENT THREE: ART USING OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

## Description: 
- This assignment requires students to use object-oriented programming to either create a work of art or to make a game. I chose to make a piece of art, because I believe that I would benefit more from employing my creativity without having to worry about technicalities of a game. 
- In this project, students are encouraged to :

## The process:
- As one may be able to tell from my previous projects, I love color. I love mixing so many colors together and having very vibrant works. So naturally, when I started thinking of my ideas for this project, I knew that I wanted something with lots of colors. And after experimenting with the colors of the rainbow last week, I decided to jump on the second most colorful thing I could think of : Flowers. My favorite flowers happen to be tulips, and luckily, they come in almost all possible colors, plus they are really easy to make using ellipses that overlap. 
- Since I knew that I was going to need multiple flowers, I decided to start with just one flower and settle for it once I liked it. So I started with overlapping ellipses to make on flower at the centre using hard coded numbers first. Once I liked what I had, I decided to make . a Flower class, so that I would be able to replicate it.

- Next I decided to instantiate other flower objects, but in different sizes, this means that I needed to figure out the proportions of the ellipses that I combined, so that I wouldn't need to hardcode numbers.

- Once that worked, I deciced to use a for-loop to make these flowers instead of calling multiple lines as that would be tiresome, especially because I am using a large screen, so I would need to write at least 400 lines; which is not wise.

## Difficulties:
- Because I randomize the colors of the flowers, I had a hard time figuring out how to stop the blinking, because it would be too hard on the eyes. I needed to figure out a way to keep the colors permanent, or in the very least... I needed to keep the colors on for longer. So, I solved this by slowing down the frameRate. This helped a lot, but I still was not satisfied with the outcome.
- I wanted to include size changes of each flower whenever the mouse was clicked. But, that would need to put all the flowers in an array, and call the function that updates their size in a for loop. This has proven to be very difficulty, and I am still trying to figure it out.
